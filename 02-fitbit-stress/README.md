## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project applied Fitbit Charge 3 wearable data to explore the relationship between heart rate patterns and self-reported stress in ICU medical residents. The study serves as a practical demonstration of how consumer-grade wearables can be leveraged for workplace stress monitoring in high-pressure industries such as healthcare.

- **Population:** 57 ICU residents at Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center  
- **Duration:** 3 weeks  
- **Device:** Fitbit Charge 3, proximity sensors, smartphone app for surveys
- **Data collected:** Continuous HR, steps, sleep metrics + daily stress surveys (midday and end-of-day)  

By combining wearable signals with self-reports of stress, the project investigated whether physiological data can serve as a reliable indicator of occupational stress. Findings from this analysis provide insights for telehealth, wellness apps, and occupational health programs looking to integrate wearables for scalable, real-time stress monitoring.

## ðŸ§  Background & Motivation  
Workplace stress is a critical issue across industries. In the ICU, physicians operate in a high-stakes, unpredictable environment where burnout rates are significantly higher than in the general population. Similar stress challenges exist in other demanding sectors such as finance, aviation, customer support, and logistics, where poor stress management can reduce performance and safety.

Wearables like Fitbit offer continuous, unobtrusive tracking of physiological data (HR, sleep, activity). If combined with contextual information (self-reports, surveys, environmental data), they can enable early stress detection and personalized interventions. This project used the TILES-2019 dataset as a real-world testbed. By analyzing ICU residentsâ€™ heart rate and stress levels during their shifts to better understand:

- How heart rate metrics reflect stress in natural work settings.
- How daily stressors (e.g., health concerns, family issues) interact with physiology.
- Why personalized models are necessary due to individual variability.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Preprocessing  
- **Source dataset:** [TILES-2019 dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01636-4)  
- **Preprocessing steps:**  
  - Removed empty files & duplicates  
  - Min-max normalization of HR  
  - Aligned HR with survey timestamps  
  - Extracted 4-hour HR segments prior to each survey (midday & evening)

## ðŸ”¬ Analysis & Methods  

### Stage 1: Correlation Analysis  
- Explored relationships between HR metrics (mean, min, median, SD, percentile-based medians, peak HR) and self-reported stress.  
- Found **weak but significant correlations** for lower HR percentiles with stress.

### Stage 2: Stressor Analysis  
- Compared stress differences between midday and evening surveys using paired t-tests.  
- Identified **daily stressors** (self-care, partner conflict, household tasks, health issues).  
- "Other health" stressors (someone elseâ€™s health) showed strongest positive correlation with stress change.

## âœ… Key Findings  
- HR alone is a **modest indicator of stress** in ICU environments.  
- Lower HR percentiles capture stress correlations better than upper percentiles.  
- Daily stressors, particularly health-related ones, influenced stress more than HR.  
- Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated **significant but individualized associations** between stress and HR.

## ðŸ“Œ Takeaways  
- For healthcare: Wearables can support stress monitoring in clinical staff, but should be combined with surveys or multimodal biomarkers (e.g., HRV, cortisol).
- For wellness apps: HR patterns can offer insight into stress but require personalization to avoid misleading results.
- For future research: Combining wearables with machine learning offers promise for scalable, real-world stress monitoring systems.
