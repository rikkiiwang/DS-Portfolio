## üìå Project Overview - Wearable Data Integrity & Anomaly Detection
This project aims to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of wearable health monitoring systems by identifying anomalies in physiological data, including heart rate and motion signals. Two human-subject experiments were conducted to simulate real-world user scenarios. A benchmark framework was developed to evaluate anomaly detection models ranging from lightweight baselines to advanced neural networks and large language models (LLMs).
The work has led to three peer-reviewed publications. These findings highlight how anomaly detection can reduce false alerts, increase trust in health insights, and support the scalable use of wearables in telehealth, fitness, insurance, and safety-critical industries.


## üìñ Background & Research Motivation
Wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch and Fitbit, have become an integral part of daily life, enabling people to track their heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. Yet, users often report false alerts (e.g., ‚Äúabnormal heart rate‚Äù notifications while resting) or missing/incorrect data when the device is worn loosely, exposed to sweat/humidity, or suffers from poor connectivity. These errors undermine user trust and limit adoption in healthcare.

From a healthcare perspective, doctors hesitate to rely on consumer wearables for remote monitoring due to concerns about uncertain data integrity. A single false alarm can lead to unnecessary clinic visits or overlooked true emergencies. From an industry perspective, users cancel subscriptions when the app‚Äôs recommendations (e.g., calorie burn or training intensity) don‚Äôt match their actual effort due to faulty data.

This project was motivated by such real-world challenges. Our goal was to improve the reliability of wearable health data by detecting anomalies caused by human behavior, environmental factors, or technical issues, ensuring more accurate and trustworthy monitoring.



## üß™ Benchmark, Metrics, and Experiment Setup
### Evaluation Metric  
- **Reconstruction Error:** Difference between input data and model reconstruction.  
- Larger errors = stronger deviation from expected "normal" patterns.  
- Used as the primary anomaly detection metric.

### Baseline Model  
- **KitNet**: Lightweight ensemble of autoencoders, originally for network intrusion detection.  
- Strengths: Fast, unsupervised, suitable for small devices.  
- Limitations: Detected obvious anomalies but struggled with subtle changes and user variability, exposing a performance gap.  

### Experiment Setup  
#### First Experiment (Pilot)  
- **Session Length:** 25 minutes  
- **Conditions:** Normal Wearing, Resting (control), Improper Wearing (loose strap)  
- **Limitation:** Small training dataset ‚Üí led to expansion in the second experiment.  

#### Second Experiment (Expanded Study)  
- **Baseline Condition (8 hours):**  
  - Participants wore Apple Watches during daily activities (10 AM ‚Äì 6 PM).  
  - Rich dataset of *normal* behavior, used for model training.  
- **Controlled In-Lab Condition (25 minutes):**  
  Each participant completed **five 5-minute sessions** including improper wearing, unstable network, elevated humidity adn two resting sessions (control).

## üìä Data Processing & Feature Engineering
The raw dataset combined Apple Watch heart rate (7‚Äì8s intervals) and motion data (1s intervals). Steps included: 
- Synchronization of heart rate and motion timestamps.
- Interpolation to fill gaps in heart rate data.
- Feature Engineering: motion magnitude (via Euclidean norm), normalization (Min-Max scaling), and segmentation into time windows for training.
- Dimensionality Reduction
  - Challenge: Motion data had 3 axes (x, y, z) while heart rate had only 1 channel.  
    - Initial autoencoder tests showed poor results ‚Äî the model overfit to motion data and ignored subtle heart rate variations.  
  - Diagnosis: The imbalance of **3 motion features vs. 1 heart rate feature** skewed the learning process.  
  - Solution: Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the motion data.  
    - Reduced the 3D motion signals into 1 principal component capturing the dominant variance.  
    - Balanced the input space into **two channels.  
  - Impact: 
    - Eliminated redundancy and noise from motion data.  
    - Ensured equal weighting of motion and heart rate inputs.  
    - Improved anomaly detection performance in the autoencoder and downstream LLM experiments.

### üîß Introduction to Autoencoders  

An autoencoder is a type of neural network designed to learn a compressed representation of data.  
It consists of two main parts:  
- **Encoder:** reduces the input into a compact latent representation (bottleneck).  
- **Decoder:** reconstructs the input from this compressed form.  

By training on *normal data only*, the autoencoder learns to reproduce expected patterns. When unusual conditions (e.g., improper wearing or high humidity) occur, the reconstruction becomes inaccurate, resulting in a **high reconstruction error**. This makes autoencoders especially powerful for anomaly detection in wearable signals, since anomalies naturally appear as poorly reconstructed patterns.  


### üß© Convolutional Autoencoder  
Convolutional Autoencoders are effective for image denoising, compression, and feature extraction because their convolutional nature preserves important spatial patterns, unlike fully connected autoencoders.

**Challenge:** Small, noisy wearable datasets ‚Üí models prone to overfitting.  
**Solution:** Hybrid ConvAE-ALSTM with Attention improved generalization, while PCA balanced HR vs. motion inputs.

### üîé Model Choice Decisions    
- **Experiment 1 (Pilot):**  
  - Adopted **GAF transformation** + CNN autoencoder because literature showed that converting time-series into images preserves temporal correlations and highlights anomalies.  
- **Experiment 2 (Expanded):**  
  - Moved to **Hybrid ConvAE-ALSTM with Attention** to capture both **spatial features** (CNN) and **temporal dependencies** (LSTM) while focusing on salient signals (Attention).  
- **Exploration of LLMs:**  
  - Tested **GPT-2 embeddings** after PCA compression, inspired by emerging work treating time series as sequential ‚Äútokens‚Äù for LLMs.  
 
### üìà Data Transformation Using GAF  
- We transformed heart rate and 3D acceleration (x, y, z) into **image representations** using the **Gramian Angular Field (GAF)** method.  
- GAF encodes time series into polar coordinates:  
  - Angular dimension = time  
  - Radial dimension = data values  
- This transformation preserves temporal correlations ‚Äî critical for anomaly detection in physiological signals.  
- We used Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF), computed from cosine/sine outer products of the polar coordinates.
