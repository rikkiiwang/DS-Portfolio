# ü§ù Trust, Explainability & Telehealth Adoption  

This folder contains two complementary projects that investigate user trust and explainability in wearable health monitoring and telehealth adoption among the aging population. Both studies bridge the gap between technical design and human factors, providing valuable insights for the development of more effective and inclusive digital health systems.

## üìå Project 1: Telehealth Adoption Among the Aging Population  

### Overview  
This study examined how **wearable device use** and **socioeconomic factors** influence **telehealth adoption** among older adults (‚â•65 years), using the HINTS 6 dataset.  

- **Dataset:** 1596 survey respondents aged 65+  
- **Methods:** Ordinal regression + mediation analysis  
- **Goal:** Understand direct/indirect effects of wearables, education, income, location, and health conditions on telehealth adoption.

### Methods  
1. **Ordinal Regression:** Tested associations between demographics, wearable use, health conditions, and adoption.  
2. **Mediation Analysis:** Explored how **education, income, and health conditions** mediate wearable‚Äìtelehealth adoption relationships.  
3. **Conceptual Model:** Illustrated direct and indirect influences on adoption pathways.  

---

### Key Results  
- **Wearable device use** increased likelihood of telehealth adoption (OR=1.32, *p*=.03).  
- **Education** and **income** strongly mediated adoption pathways.  
- **Rural residents** showed significantly lower adoption (*p*=.003).  
- **Better health status** ‚Üí less perceived need for telehealth.

## üìå Project 2: Trust & Explainability in Wearable Health Monitoring  

### Overview  
This follow-up survey study explored **trust, usability, visualization, and explainability (XAI)** in **AI-driven wearable health monitoring**.  
Participants had previously joined an Apple Watch anomaly detection experiment.  

- **Participants:** 25 (aged 20‚Äì32, prior experiment group)  
- **Methods:** Online survey (Qualtrics), 26 questions, SUS + Likert scales  
- **Focus:** How usability, visualization, contextual information, and explainable AI affect user confidence and adherence.
