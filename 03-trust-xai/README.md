# 🤝 Trust, Explainability & Telehealth Adoption  

This folder highlights two projects that connect advanced analytics with real-world human impact. Both demonstrate how data science and system design can directly shape the future of digital health, making healthcare more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy.

## 📌 Project 1: Telehealth Adoption Among the Aging Population  

### 🏥 Why It Matters 
Telehealth can reduce hospital visits, cut costs, and improve access — yet older adults often hesitate to adopt it. Understanding why is critical for industry players who want to expand telehealth to the population that needs it most.

### 🔬 What I Did
- Dataset: U.S. National Cancer Institute’s HINTS 6 survey (2022) with 1,596 respondents aged 65+.
- Methods:
    - Ordinal regression to test associations between telehealth adoption and predictors (wearable use, demographics, health).
    - Mediation analysis to reveal indirect effects of education, income, and health status on adoption pathways.
    - Conceptual model built to visualize direct and mediated effects.
- Goal: Identify drivers and barriers to adoption among older adults

### 📈 Key Insights 
- Wearable device use increased likelihood of telehealth adoption (OR=1.32, *p*=.03).  
- Education and income were powerful mediators → higher education/income → more likely to adopt.
- Rural residents showed significantly lower adoption, reflecting digital divide challenges. (*p*=.003).  
- Healthier individuals were less likely to adopt → less perceived need for telehealth.

## 📌 Project 2: Trust & Explainability in Wearable Health Monitoring  

### 🧑‍⚕️ Why It Matters  
AI-powered wearables (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit) can provide health recommendations in real-time. But will people trust them enough to act? Trust and usability aren’t just “nice-to-haves” — they’re deal-breakers for adoption in healthcare.

### 🔬 What I Did
- Participants: 25 users (aged 20–32) recruited from a prior Apple Watch data integrity study.
- Survey Design: 26 questions, mixing System Usability Scale (SUS) with Likert ratings and controlled scenarios.
- Focus Areas Tested:
    - Usability (SUS scoring)
    - Data visualization (Apple Watch UI vs. detailed summary)
    - Contextual info (raw heart rate vs. heart rate + environment)
    - Explainable AI (XAI) (recommendations with vs. without explanation)

### 📈 Key Insights 
- Usability baseline: SUS score of 78.4 (Good usability), showing users found Apple Watch generally reliable.
- Visualization matters: Users preferred detailed visual summaries over small watch-screen displays — clarity builds trust.
- Contextual info ≠ game-changer: Adding factors like humidity did not significantly boost trust — users prioritize data clarity over complexity.
- Explainability helps (a little): AI recommendations with explanations slightly increased trust and adherence, though the effect wasn’t statistically strong.
